## ABOUT THE PROJECT

This is a Python project for creating an interactive Tableau dashbaord that enables homebuyers and investors to identify seasonal price fluctuations, assess high-growth investment areas, and compare historical housing market trends. I have built a scalable data pipeline to process 7M+ rows of Zillow housing market records-- leveraging Pandas for data cleaning and PostgreSQL for imputing 2M+ missing values using city-level medians to enhance data accuracy for trend analysis.
